# DIG: Draping Implicit Garment over the Human Body
This is the repo for ["DIG: Draping Implicit Garment over the Human Body"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10845).

Here we provide the code and the pretrained models to generate garments and drape them on the posed human body.

## Pre-requisites for running
The code is implemented with python 3.6 and torch 1.9.0+cu102 (other versions may also work).

Other dependencies include `trimesh`, `torchgeometry`, `scikit-image`.
